Welcome to LuCLI's documentation!
=================================

**LuCLI** (/lu'klÉª/) is a command-line utility built to facilitate
the *fast* and **simple** ordering of foodstuffs for the ultimate
goal of dining on fine cuisine as you enjoy a short respite from
the cacophonous environment of your workplace.

New: We've finished v0.2 and are now working to give you the
much-requested v0.3 with the new `order-pizza <cli-main.html#main-order-pizza>`_
command! This is yet a work-in-progress though (pizzas are hard to
make!) and is thus still a little buggy.

.. note::

   This project is under very active development except for when
   the developers are out to lunch.

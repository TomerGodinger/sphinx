Welcome to LuCLI's documentation!
=================================

**LuCLI** (/lu'klɪ/) is a command-line utility built to facilitate
the *fast* and **simple** ordering of foodstuffs for the ultimate
goal of dining on fine cuisine as you enjoy a short respite from
the cacophonous environment of your workplace.

New: We’ve finished v0.1 and are now hard at work on the next version!

.. note::

   This project is under very active development except for when
   the developers are out to lunch.
